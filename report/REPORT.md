# WAGER redesign report

_Within-cell Antisymmetric Gain Evaluation of Reasoning_

## What changed

The self-prior projection, ONS betting process, e-value/growth-rate identity, calibration
corollary, Fieller RGR interval, and `RGR < 0.5` verdict have been removed from the paper.
The new WAGER is a direct algorithm for a pair of frozen models:

1. Form the proper-score gain vector `H_i(y)` of the new model over the old model.
2. Transport labels only among examples with the same declared prior feature `phi`.
3. Subtract crossed assignment gain from observed assignment gain.
4. Report the exact decomposition `total = prior-transported + instance-alignment`.

The alignment component is an order-two U-statistic. Under the quadratic score it equals
twice the within-cell covariance gained between probability changes and the correct label.

## Validation

- New unit suite: **8/8 passed**; complete repository suite: **16/16 passed**.
- Controlled null: type-I error **0.030** at level 0.05 over 200 runs.
- Signal recovery: monotone for injected signal `beta = 0.0, ..., 0.8`.
- Visual Genome coverage: **227,337 / 229,605 = 99.0%** test relations.

## Visual Genome results

Quadratic-score gains; intervals are image-cluster robust.

| New vs old | Total | Prior-transported | Instance alignment (95% CI) | Share | Randomization p |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| MLP-CLASS vs FREQ | 0.03386 | 0.03386 | 0.00000 [0.00000, 0.00000] | 0.00 | .724 |
| MLP-SPATIAL vs FREQ | 0.04270 | 0.02832 | 0.01439 [0.01373, 0.01504] | 0.34 | .002 |
| MLP-SPATIAL+ vs FREQ | 0.04644 | 0.02885 | 0.01760 [0.01686, 0.01834] | 0.38 | .002 |
| MLP-SPATIAL vs MLP-CLASS | 0.00885 | -0.00554 | 0.01439 [0.01373, 0.01504] | 1.63 | .002 |
| MLP-SPATIAL+ vs MLP-SPATIAL | 0.00374 | 0.00053 | 0.00321 [0.00289, 0.00353] | 0.86 | .002 |

The share above one for SPATIAL vs CLASS is informative: spatial alignment improves more
than the aggregate score because the prior component deteriorates. This is why the new
paper treats signed alignment gain as primary and does not threshold a ratio.
